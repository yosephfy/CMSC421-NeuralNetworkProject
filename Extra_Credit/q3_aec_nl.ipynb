    "\n",
    "1. The function first identifies which samples are correctly and incorrectly classified by comparing `y_true` and `y_pred`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using matplotlib's `scatter` function:\n",
    "    - Correctly classified samples are plotted in blue with circles (`marker='o'`).\n",
    "    - Incorrectly classified samples are plotted in red with crosses (`marker='x'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The plot is then decorated with appropriate labels, a legend, and a grid. The x-axis represents the feature values, while the y-axis represents the class (either true or predicted). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, the plot is displayed using `plt.show()`.\n",
